# Group-7-Project

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Project Overview**

As part of the final project of the Data Analytics Bootcamp at the University of Toronto, students have been assigned to groups in order to confirm their knowledge of the underlying concepts of data analytics and data science tools including their proficiency in Python, SQL, Pandas, and their ability to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data, and finally perform an analysis on the data to derive conclusions and provide a recommendation to potential employers. 

Group 7, has selected an open-source dataset from Kaggle that that contains data pertaining to a number of indicators of heart disease. The group will use the heart disease dataset to determine which indicators are factors for heart disease and further go on to test a machine learning model that can accurately predict which factors lead to heart disease. As part of the project, the heart dataset will be stored in a SQL database using PgAdmin, cleaned used the ETL process through Pandas, and tested through a machine learning model that will be developed by the group. Due to the complexity of this task, we will design and train a deep learning neural network that will evaluate all types of input data and produce a clear decision-making result, that will allow us to draw conclusions from our data.


## Goals:

Determine which factors are key indicators of heart disease based on the data provided.
Create a SQL database to store and load the dataset.
Clean the data to provide to allow for testing using machine learning.
Select and develop a machine learning model for testing.
Using the machine learning model, determine its ability to accurately predict heart disease.

**Presentation**

A link to the powerpoint presentation and weekly task tracker can be found here: https://github.com/Rangisal/Group-7-Project/blob/main/Data%20Analytics%20Group%207%20Workflow%20Procedure.pptx.

**Approach**
We will be using the Agile approach to project management. Based on the fact that team members are not familiar with each other and come from different skill levels, we required a methodology that is be flexible, yet still provide clear goals and tasks. This seemed particularly relevant as each team member can harness their own strengths for deliverables and apply them to weekly tasks. 
Furthermore, this approach prevents members from being solely responsible for one task throughout and encourages a collaborative team. 

**Communication Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**

1. Weekly meeting will be held on Tuesday and Thursday of each week (1900-2100).
2. All group discussion will be conduced on the “Group 7 Chat” on Slack.
3. Consult weekly task list.
4. Provide initial/update code as required.
5. After each major update to code or 1 hour of work, upload to GitHub under individual branch.
6. Once committed to individual branch, tag to a specific member for review. 
7. The reviewing member is to make changes/suggestions as necessary for the specified code to which they have been tagged.
8. The reviewing member will then upload code to their own branch and tag the original member.
9. Original member will review code and upload to main page.
10. Alert the team to all commits to main GitHub page.
11. All code uploaded to the main page should be reviewed by at least 1 other member. 

**Topic Selection**
We selected a dataset that analyses factors that lead to heart disease. We reviewed several other open-source datasets however, we selected this one based on interest, its relevancy, and the ability of the created machine learning model to be applicable to real world scenarios and provide a foundation from which similar datasets could be anlaysed.

A link to the dataset can be foudn here : https://github.com/Rangisal/Group-7-Project/blob/main/Resources/heart_disease_key_indicators.csv.

**Questions To Be Answered**

We hope to answer the following questions throughout the project:

1. What are the key indicators that lead to heart disease. 
2. What factors had the greatest influence on a person developing heart disease and in what proportions.
3. Can a machine learning model accurately predict whether a person will develop heart disease based on the data provided.
